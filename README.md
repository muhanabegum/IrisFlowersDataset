# IrisFlowersDataset
Learning data visualization and statistical summaries using the iris flowers dataset online using Python in Jupyter Notebooks and Machine Learning Mastery's tutorial.  

Run the code in a Jupyter Notebook to see the data analysis and charts. 

First I began to understand the basics of analyzing the data by seeing how many columns/rows it has, a brief preview of the info and also some basic stats of each column.

I also explored using charts and tables to summarize the data for key information.

More images can be seen within the repository of the ouputs or you can download and run the code yourself in Jupyter Notebook.
